# Learning React

### Some Points

- React is a Library helps in making consistency in UI
- Must have knowledge of JS and DOM
- Core of React(State or UI Management)
- Component reusability
- Reusing of components(Props)
- How to propagate changes(Hooks)
- React consists of React-DOM and React-Native
- React-DOM for Web and React-Native for App

### Creating React App

- Can be create using "npx create-react-app appname"(Slow approach, Inconvenient)
- We will use vite utility to avoid unnecessary bulky files using npm create vite@latest
- also run npm install to get node modules and other files
- JSX - means javascript with html
- to use the variables we need to use them inside {}
- while exporting from app.jsx the return just returns a single element, that's other elements are wrapped inside <></>

### Understanding Hooks by creating a counter project

- UI updation is controlled by React, that's why hooks are needed to get the control
- Hooks in React are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components without needing to write a class
- Basically, to reflect the changes in UI, we are using the concepts of hooks
